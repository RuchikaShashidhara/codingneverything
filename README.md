   Figure out main funtion for:

* Trees:    
    * same-tree.cpp
    * symmetric-tree.cpp
    * maximum-depth-of-binary-tree.cpp (yet to implement iterative solution as well)
    * binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii.cpp
    * balanced-binary-tree (implemented with class variable ans, yet to implement with class itself)
    * minimum-depth-of-binary-tree.cpp (implemented a very slow algo, yet to implement recursive & iterative algos)
    * path-sum.cpp (implemented a very slow algo, yet to implement recursive & iterative algos)
