   Yet to complete:

Easy:   

* Trees:    
    * same-tree.cpp

    * binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii.cpp
    * balanced-binary-tree (implemented with class variable ans, yet to implement with class itself)
    * minimum-depth-of-binary-tree.cpp (implemented a very slow algo, yet to implement recursive & iterative algos)
    * path-sum.cpp (implemented a very slow algo, yet to implement recursive & iterative algos)
    * convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree.cpp (implemented a very slow algo, yet to implement recursive & iterative algos)

* Stacks
   * min-stack.cpp (output is not being printed)

* Lists
   * intersection-of-two-linked-lists.cpp

* Bit Manipulation
   * reverse-bits.cpp      (implement cin, cout for uint32_t)
   * number-of-1-bits.cpp   (implement cin, cout for uint32_t)

* Strings
   * strstr.cpp (whole problem, 28)

* Other
   * majority-element.cpp (implement Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm)
   * first-bad-version.cpp (implement correct costructor class in main)

Medium
